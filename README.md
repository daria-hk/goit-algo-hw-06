### Conclusions to  draw_graph.py
**Results:**
I used shell_layout. Each nested list represents a separate shell, and the numbers in this list correspond to the indices of the nodes that should be placed at that level.
In the given example pos = [[0], [1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8]] :
* First shell ([0]) includes node with indices 0. These node will be placed on the first level of the layout.
* Second shell ([1, 2, 3]) includes nodes with indices 1, 2 and 3. These nodes will be placed on the second level of the layout.
* Third shell ([4, 5]) includes nodes with indices 4 and 5. These nodes will be placed on the third level of the layout.
* Fourth shell ([6, 7, 8]) includes nodes with indices 6, 7 and 8. These nodes will be placed on the last level of the layout.

Number of nodes: 9.
Number of edges: 36.
These characteristics indicate that the graph is very dense (because it is complete) and every vertex is connected to every other vertex. 
This provides maximum connectivity and the shortest possible path between any two vertices, which can be important for modeling transportation networks or other systems where high connectivity is important.
